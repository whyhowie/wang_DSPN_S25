It provides the reaction times (in milliseconds) of many subjects as they are presented with letter strings and asked to decide, as quickly and as accurately as possible, whether the letter string is a word or not. The **Items.csv** provides characteristics of the words used, namely frequency (how common is this word?) and length (how many letters?). Unlike in the previous homework, there isn't any missing data in the **LexicalData.csv** file. \n",
